# The Refactored Blog (public version)

This repository is the publich version of the [The Refactored Blog](https://refactored-blog.vercel.app/) website.

The main motive for having a public version of the repository of the said website is because of security and privacy concerns, being the original repository contains the private keys with Admin Access to the backend. This public repo serves the purpose of sharing the code without the need to reveal the sensitive data. Regardless, the public codebase contains the exact same code and file structure as the original codebase just without the private keys.

For the less sensitive data like the `config/firebaseApp.config.js`, the author decided to retain it since it's also exposed to the front-end and is normally included in the client side. The additional security rules from the backend is what makes the security with the said config safe.

Nevertheless, thanks for understanding and may you have a nice day!
